title: 'Developing a Structure'

summary: 'I try to develop some structure in my life to make my thoughts less scattered'
---
Sometimes, in a moment of brilliance, I come up with ideas that seem awesome and cool. These ideas can occupy my thoughts for what feels like days at a time. During these days, as I walk around at work, cook food, read articles, or do anything, my mind is stuck on these ideas. I feel like I make progress on them and keep building upon themâ€”until I move on. My mind shifts to something else, and all that mental energy feels wasted as these ideas slip through the cracks.

So how do I fix this? I need to write these ideas down and keep them together. I need a list of tasks so that when boredom hits, I have something to work on immediately. I need structure.


## To-Do List

1. **This website**

    I figure it would probably be a good idea since my new sense of discipline and stream of motivation has led me to finally put together a portfolio site. I should finish this so that it doesn't become one of those projects that sits there half-working and half-finished.

    Of course, the site will never truly be done; there will always be stuff I would like to add to it.
    - [ ] Chess Tracker
    - [ ] Make it more personal
        - I'd like to add a little dice roller like from Baldur's Gate
    - [ ] Add more room in the nav
    - [ ] Finances Guide

2. **Europa Universalis 4 App**

    For the most part, I would consider this to be mostly finished, but now there are some aspects that need to be addressed now that the core functionality is done.
    - Lack of clarity regarding sent requests (Loading Bar)
    - Bug when using the search bar, sometimes the requests go through, sometimes it appears like they don't
    - Animations? The site feels clunky

3. **r/NYY Sentiment Analysis**

    This project is still really new; I haven't really done much but the frontend.
    - Build Classifier to attach the subject of the comment
    - Analyze the sentiment of threads
    - Scraper to get roster (40 Man or current 26 plus prospects)
    - Add chart to track each individual player's sentiment score alongside winrate graph
        - Maybe add in for each day how the player performed to see if the performance warrants the sentiment
    - Add Cards to track the current highest and lowest sentiment scoring players, and maybe highest uptick or downtick in score

4. **KnowYourPolitician Map**

    Still brainstorming ideas.
    - Overhead view of the U.S. Map, showing the current House and Senate splits
    - Toggle between Senate and House Mode
        - House Mode can show the districts overlaid on the Map
            - When clicked, each district will pop up a card that shows the Politician, their party, educational background, election year, when they are up for reelection. Use a LLM to create a small abstract regarding that person's platform and positions.
            - Add color to display what party controls the seat
    - When clicked on each state, list some important information, like electoral votes

5. **Homelab**

    There are a lot of things I would like to start with the homelab...
    - Minecraft server
    - PfSense VM
    - Plex
    - AdGuard / PiHole

    This should probably be higher on the list, to be honest, purely based on how long I've put this off.

6. **Whimsy40**

    It's been like a year; build the keyboard already.
